OpenKNX - PresenceModule
===

Implementation of a knx presence module with up to 50 presence channels based on the [knx stack](https://github.com/thelsing/knx) from thelsing and the [OpenKNX](https://github.com/OpenKNX) infrastructure.

Application description (including a feature overview) can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenKNX/OAM-PresenceModule/blob/main/doc/Applikationbeschreibung-Praesenz.md).

It supports the SAMD and RP2040 version of the stack.

It is a PlatformIO project and needs a working ETS 5.7 installed on the same PC.

This PreseceModule part can be used as an OpenKNX module combined with other OpenKNX modules (i.e. [logic module](https://github.com/OpenKNX/OAM-LogicModule)) together in one firmware and one ETS-Application.
